//! # **Custom Value Trait Module** - *Makes all your Any+Send+Sync types automatically compatible with Minarrow*
//!
//! Includes the [`CustomValue`] trait, enabling storage of arbitrary user-defined
//! types inside [`enums::Value::Custom`] while maintaining a unified interface
//! with scalars, arrays, and tables.
//!
//! This mechanism supports advanced or intermediate pipeline states—such as
//! partial aggregates, sketches, or engine-specific outputs—that do not fit into
//! the standard Arrow type system.
//!
//! Dynamic dispatch and `Any` downcasting allow recovery of the concrete type
//! at runtime for type-specific operations. The library provides a blanket
//! implementation so that any `Send + Sync + Clone + PartialEq + Debug + 'static`
//! type can be used without manual implementation.
//!
//! ## Key Points
//! - Enables integration of custom, non-Arrow types in Minarrow pipelines.
//! - Supports deep cloning, semantic equality, and safe downcasting.
//! - Borrowed types are not supported; use owned types or `Arc`.
//! - Intended for specialised use cases; most data should use Arrow-compatible arrays.

/// # Custom Value
///
/// Trait for any object that can be stored in `enums::Value::Custom`.
///
/// `CustomValue` extends *MinArrow's* `Value` universe, allowing engines or
/// analytics to handle intermediate states and custom types
/// within the same pipeline abstraction as scalars, arrays, and tables.
///
/// You must then manage downcasting on top of the base enum match, so it
/// it's not the most ergonomic situation, but is available.
///
/// Typical use cases include:
/// - Accumulators, partial aggregates, or sketches.
/// - Custom algorithm outputs.
/// - Arbitrary user-defined types requiring unified pipeline integration.
///
/// **Dynamic dispatch and downcasting** are used at runtime to recover the inner type
/// and perform type-specific logic, such as merging, reduction, or finalisation.
///
/// ### Implementation Notes:
/// - **Manual implementation is not required**.  
/// - Any type that implements `Debug`, `Clone`, `PartialEq`, and is `Send + Sync + 'static`
///   automatically satisfies `CustomValue` via the blanket impl.
/// - `Any` is automatically implemented by Rust for all `'static` types.  
///
/// ### Borrowing Constraints:
/// - **Borrowed types cannot be used in `Value::Custom` directly**, since `Any` requires `'static`.  
/// - To store borrowed data, first promote it to an owned type or wrap it in `Arc`.
pub trait CustomValue: Any + Send + Sync + std::fmt::Debug {
    /// Downcasts the type as `Any`
    fn as_any(&self) -> &dyn Any;
    /// Returns a deep clone of the object.
    ///
    /// Additionally, the `Value` enum automatically derives `Clone`, which is a
    /// shallow `Arc` clone by default.
    fn deep_clone(&self) -> Arc<dyn CustomValue>;

    /// Performs semantic equality on the boxed object.
    ///
    /// This enables `PartialEq` to be implemented for `Value`,
    /// since `dyn CustomValue` cannot use `==` directly.
    fn eq_box(&self, other: &dyn CustomValue) -> bool;
}

/// Provided extension types implement `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Debug`
/// and is `Send` + `Sync + Any`, these methods implement automatically.
